    <h3>The code explaination</h3>
    <p>
        The recommended way to handle such cases, where there are so much of dom manipulations every fraction of second is React.JS.
    </p>
    <p>
        Using React, there would be a remarkable improvement in the page and website performance, as React maintains a virtual DOM and only injects the changes which are required to be changed in the DOM.
    </p>
    <p>
        If I had some more time, I would have implemented the solution in React as then I only had to maintain and update the state and re-rendering part would have been efficiently handled by React.
        Unit testing frameworks like Enzyme/Jest can also be used with React Applications.
    </p>

    <p>
        With React the sorting thing and reordering would automatically be handled in an efficient way as whenever we update the state in an immutable way it will automatically detect the changes.
